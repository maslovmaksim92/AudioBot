<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed the VasDom application, incorporating multiple features and fixes. Initially, a comprehensive CSV report, Telegram photo history, and KPI fixes were implemented. The Plannerka (Meetings) module was then introduced, transitioning from Web Speech API to a more accurate OpenAI Whisper-based real-time transcription via WebSockets due to user feedback. This module was also integrated into the Tasks section for AI-powered summarization and task extraction.

Subsequently, a Telegram-based authentication system with QR codes was built, then simplified to a standard login/password due to user preference, involving fixing user creation, password hashes, and timezone issues for scheduler jobs. An automated call summarization system was developed, integrating with Bitrix24 for call data and scheduling an agent to process and send summaries to Telegram. Frontend improvements included a new Call Summaries section and error suppression. The last task involved addressing issues with call summaries not being sent to Telegram and expanding Novofon integration, with the engineer in the process of updating the .

<product_requirements>
The VasDom application, a Single Brain AI Assistant, manages cleaning operations by integrating with Bitrix24 and Telegram, utilizing a PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and React stack.
**Core Modules & Features:**
*   **Works**: Manages houses and cleanings, featuring Telegram photo uploads with AI captions, act signed functionality, and KPI tracking. Enhanced with an accurate CSV report (up to 499 houses, including elder contacts, with quick/full report options) and a Telegram photo history feature (displaying post links). KPI Brigade statistics were fixed for monthly calculations.
*   **Tasks**: Supports manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks. The Планерка (Meetings) section was reintroduced, offering dictaphone recording, real-time transcription (now using OpenAI Whisper for accuracy), AI-powered summarization, and task extraction, with data stored in the DB and integrated into the Tasks section.
*   **Telegram Bot**: Lists houses filtered by brigade/date, allows photo uploads with AI captions, forwards photos/captions to Telegram groups, and displays accurate house details. Now features dynamic house listings per brigade for the current day.
*   **Authentication**: Initially featured Telegram login with QR code, which was later replaced by a standard login/password system with user management and Moscow timezone support for scheduled events.
*   **Call Summaries**: New system for automatic summarization of Novofon/Bitrix24 calls, with summaries to be sent to Telegram.

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure automatic call summaries are successfully sent to the correct Telegram chat ID.
-   Integrate deeper with Novofon API to ensure call summary processing for *all* relevant numbers, not just those currently being tracked by Bitrix24.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two user-reported issues related to the automated call summarization system:
1.  **Call summaries were not being sent to the designated Telegram chat.** The user provided a new  ().
2.  **The call summarization needed to be expanded to cover all Novofon numbers.**

The AI engineer's most recent action was to locate the  variable in the  file. The trajectory ends at the point of identifying the old chat ID and before the actual update to the new user-provided value. The intention is to update this environment variable and then verify the agent's functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update  in  to , then restart the backend and test the call summary agent.

Давайте сначала обновлю chat ID и проверю работу агента: (Chat Message 614)
Вижу старый chat ID. Обновлю на новый: (Chat Message 616)
