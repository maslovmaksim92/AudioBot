The AI engineer's work centered on significantly enhancing the Finances module of the VasDom application, primarily developing and refining a complex financial forecasting feature across multiple company models. Initially, efforts focused on accurately implementing the УФИЦ модель forecast, which required extensive iterative adjustments to calculation logic, indexing rates, and category-specific revenue/expense distribution based on detailed Excel data and user feedback.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to the ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ forecast, involving the re-definition of growth rates, margin targets, and complex expense reallocations (e.g., reassigning Текущий ремонт or Юридические услуги to Зарплата). The engineer also integrated detailed scenario descriptions and unit economics. Throughout the trajectory, the process involved frequent backend () and frontend () modifications, rigorous debugging of variable scope issues, and continuous re-testing to align with evolving and precise user requirements. The final phase began with preparing to integrate УФИЦ модель cleaner revenue into ВАШ ДОМ модель expenses.

The VasDom app needed an advanced Financial Analysis module for management reports, evolving significantly. Initially, a **Consolidated Financial View (ВАШ ДОМ модель)** was required, merging ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ and УФИЦ модель data with specific category exclusions (e.g., Кредиты) and reallocations (e.g., Аутсорсинг персонала). Company names were standardized (e.g., ООО ВАШ ДОМ to ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ). A **Forecasting Module (Прогноз 26-30)** was mandated, initially simple extrapolation, but rapidly evolved into a dedicated tab with model selection (ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, УФИЦ модель, ВАШ ДОМ модель), three scenarios (Pessimistic, Realistic, Optimistic), and Расчеты для инвестора. A critical aspect was the integration of **УФИЦ модель forecast data from Excel**, requiring precise per-job-place calculations, annual indexing, and detailed breakdowns including unit economics. Later, **ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ forecast** also received detailed scenario descriptions, growth rate adjustments (e.g., revenue growth 30% instead of 60%), expense reallocations (e.g., -70% Текущий ремонт to Зарплата, removing Юридические услуги), and target margins. A pending task is to remap УФИЦ модель 'Уборщицы' revenue to ВАШ ДОМ модель 'Аутсорсинг персонала' expense and adjust ФОТ.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles all financial API logic.
    -   **Changes**: Received extensive updates for , , , and most notably, the  endpoint. The  endpoint's logic was entirely rewritten multiple times to incorporate complex УФИЦ модель and ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ scenario calculations, dynamic indexing, category-specific expense/revenue breakdowns, investor metrics (40M investment), detailed scenario descriptions, and unit economics. Various bug fixes related to variable initialization were also implemented. Expense exclusions and reallocations (e.g., Ленинск-Кузнецкий removal, Текущий ремонт shift to Зарплата) were integrated.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the financial forecast UI.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include new UI elements for detailed revenue/expense breakdowns, scenario descriptions, and unit economics. Logic for showing detailed breakdowns was generalized to apply to all relevant company models. Replaced ФОТ with Расходы for consistency and removed duplicate rendering blocks.
-   **, , **:
    -   **Importance**: Utility scripts for initial data setup and migration.
    -   **Changes**: Not modified in this trajectory, but their functionality remains crucial for the application's data foundation.

    -   **Importance**: Temporary script for fetching UFIC expenses.
    -   **Changes**: Created but not ultimately used as the approach shifted to directly modifying .
-   **, **:
    -   **Importance**: User-provided Excel data and its parsed JSON representation, critical for УФИЦ модель forecast calculations.
    -   **Changes**:  was processed, and  was created to store its parsed contents for use in the backend.

-   **ВАШ ДОМ модель Recalculation**: Integrate Уборщицы revenue from УФИЦ модель (per scenario/year) as Аутсорсинг персонала expense in ВАШ ДОМ модель, reducing ФОТ accordingly.
-   **Frontend Renaming**: Change display name of ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ to ВАШ ДОМ+УФИЦ in the frontend.
-   Verify Novofon API integration and  functionality (from initial ).
-   Further development/integration for Budgets and Plan-Fact Analysis components (from initial ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a complex update to the ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ forecast model and preparing for a major recalculation for the ВАШ ДОМ модель. The user requested several specific changes for ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ: refined margin targets (27.58%-36.42% for optimistic), removal of юридические услуги from expenses (reallocated to зарплата), and the addition of a Сценарий block with detailed introductory descriptions for both ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ and УФИЦ модель. The AI engineer successfully implemented these backend changes in , adjusting expense exclusions, growth rates, and adding the detailed descriptions. The corresponding frontend changes in  to display these descriptions were also completed.

Following this, the user clarified a critical change for the ВАШ ДОМ модель: the revenue from Уборщицы in the УФИЦ модель forecast (for each scenario and year) should be treated as an Аутсорсинг персонала expense within the ВАШ ДОМ модель forecast, with a corresponding reduction in ФОТ (labor) for ВАШ ДОМ модель. The user also explicitly confirmed that ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ should only be renamed to ВАШ ДОМ+УФИЦ in the *frontend display*, not in the database. The AI engineer is currently preparing to implement this recalculation for the ВАШ ДОМ модель.
