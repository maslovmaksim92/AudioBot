The AI engineer successfully transitioned the project to the VasDom application, migrating the backend from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and implementing core Single Brain AI assistant features. Initial tasks included fixing LiveKit API imports, installing dependencies, and resolving critical logic errors in month detection and cleaning periodicity calculations. The UI was restyled with a minimalistic design and a new logo, fixing an initial blank page issue.

Subsequently, the engineer initiated the Telegram bot integration for cleaning brigades, incorporating AI-generated motivational captions for photo uploads without visual analysis, and setting up database migrations for  table. Currently, the engineer is implementing Act Signed functionality within the Works module, including a button on house cards and backend API for statistics, along with new frontend components for act statistics. Throughout, the AI prioritized user feedback, iteratively fixing reported bugs and clearly communicating the development plan.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom application evolved from AudioBot, migrating its backend to PostgreSQL. It features a Single Brain AI Assistant supporting voice commands, data analysis, predictive analytics, and Telegram authorization, avoiding LLMs for factual data by directly querying Bitrix24 and PostgreSQL. Key modules include Finances, Agent Builder (Telegram notifications, APScheduler, knowledge base), and Render Logs. The Brain requires advanced address normalization, intent-based routing, caching, and self-learning capabilities from messages and calls.

Dashboard modules include:
- **Works:** House/cleaning management, photo upload via Telegram (with AI captions), act signed button, KPI, and periodicity logic.
- **Tasks:** Manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks with a calendar.
- **Employees:** Staff management, roles, KPIs, and brigade calendar.
- **AI Chat:** Synchronized with Telegram, handles complaints with photos, and provides AI-driven responses.
- **Meetings:** Transcription, summary, task creation.
- **Training:** Educational materials, tracking.
- **AI-Tasks:** Scheduler for periodic and one-time tasks.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing Iteration 3: Act Signed Statistics. This involves adding a Act Signed button to individual house cards within the  section of the frontend, and developing the corresponding backend API endpoints to record and retrieve signed act data.

Specifically, the following has been completed within this iteration:
1.  **Backend Database**: A new SQL migration file, , was created to define the table for storing signed acts. This migration was added to the automatic migration runner () to be executed on application startup.
2.  **Backend API Endpoints**: New API routes,  (to mark an act as signed) and  (to get monthly statistics), were added to .
3.  **Frontend Components**:
    *    was created as a new UI component for the modal dialog that will appear when the Act Signed button is clicked.
    *    was created to display the statistics related to signed acts.
4.  **Frontend Integration**: The  component was significantly updated:
    *   It now imports the newly created  and  components.
    *   A new Акты (Acts) tab was added to the tab navigation within the Works section.
    *   The Акт подписан button was integrated into the display of individual house cards, with functionality to open the .
    *   A fix was applied to ensure the modal callback ( changed to ) correctly triggers the desired actions upon act signing.

The backend and frontend services were restarted after these changes. The migrations were noted to be skipped locally, as expected, to run on the Render deployment.
