The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating features from 25 historical  branches into the  branch of the AudioBot application, aiming for parity with a production deployment. The process involved extensive usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)

   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

See 'git help git' for an overview of the system. operations, file system manipulations, and code edits to consolidate various backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) components. Key challenges included resolving database conflicts (initially PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB, then switching to an API-only/in-memory approach for Render deployment) and debugging API-to-UI connectivity issues for features like AI Chat, Dashboard, and Meetings. Despite an initial successful auto-test, user feedback revealed significant functional regressions, necessitating further diagnostics and fixes for mobile responsiveness and core feature integration. The AI demonstrated iterative problem-solving, though some issues persist, notably frontend display of data that the backend correctly provides.

<product_requirements>
The user requires the AudioBot application (https://github.com/maslovmaksim92/AudioBot) to be developed iteratively, always moving forward from the  branch. The primary goal is to consolidate the best working code from 25 historical  branches into a single, clean  branch, resulting in a fully functional application identical to the production deployment at https://audiobot-qci2.onrender.com.

Specific functional requirements include:
-   **Dashboard**: Display 490 houses, 82 employees, and other statistics from Bitrix24. The user specifically asked for the most beautiful dashboard with fully loaded Bitrix data.
-   **AI Chat**: Implement a functional AI chat interface.
-   **Meetings/Planerki**: Implement working meeting recording with live transcription and AI analysis.
-   **Houses (Дома)**: Ensure Bitrix24 integration loads and displays houses correctly.
-   **Employees (Сотрудники)**: Display 6 brigades with detailed employee information.
-   **Self-Learning Module (Обучение)**: Integrate a RAG-based self-learning system with log export, fine-tuning, and cron-based quality assessment.
-   **Voice System**: Implement advanced voice modules including realistic voice (OpenAI TTS), real-time GPT-4o API, and WebSocket for live chat.
-   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure good mobile adaptation.
-   **Cleanup**: Remove unused files, duplicate code, and improve commit history.
-   **API Integration**: Backend must be FastAPI, frontend React, leveraging Bitrix24, Emergent LLM (GPT-4 mini), Telegram Bot, and MongoDB (later switched to API-only/in-memory for Render).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend framework for API development.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, used for persistence.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Relational database, initially configured but then abandoned due to environment.
-   **Bitrix24 API**: CRM integration for house and employee data.
-   **Emergent LLM (GPT-4 mini)**: AI model for chat and voice processing.
-   **WebSocket**: Real-time communication for live chat and voice.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Frontend styling framework.
-   **Git Operations**: Branch merging, diff analysis, cherry-picking.
-   **Supervisor**: Process control system for managing backend/frontend services.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, deployed in a Kubernetes environment.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : This is the core FastAPI application. It was significantly refactored to integrate various routers (dashboard, voice, telegram, cleaning, analytics, learning, ai_chat) and manage startup/shutdown events. Initially configured for PostgreSQL, it was later modified to run without a database (API-only/in-memory for chat sessions) to comply with the Render environment constraint.
-   : Initially contained PostgreSQL configuration. Modified to remove PostgreSQL-specific logic and eventually removed MongoDB setup as well, shifting to an API-only approach.
-   , : These files were created and updated to correctly set  (later removed) and , ensuring no hardcoded URLs.
-   : Integrated a SUPER Dashboard by combining features from  (districts) and  (real-time data) to display Bitrix24 statistics.
-   : This component was integrated and debugged for frontend-to-backend API connectivity issues.
-   , , , : These were crucial voice-related components integrated from early  branches (e.g., , ).
-   : A comprehensive Bitrix24 service (953 lines, 26 methods) was integrated from , crucial for CRM data handling.
-    (directory): Integrated from  for self-learning functionalities, including  and .
-   , , : Modified to improve mobile responsiveness and navigation.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **AI CHAT**: The frontend interface is not fully working, despite the backend API endpoint being created.
-   **Meetings (Планерки)**: Recording and analysis functionalities are not working.
-   **Houses (Дома)**: Dashboard UI does not display houses, although the API provides the data.
-   **Self-Learning (Обучение)**: Functionality cannot be verified.
-   **Mobile Adaptivity**: The mobile version has poor responsiveness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer was working on resolving critical issues reported by the user, specifically addressing the discrepancy between the automatic test results and actual application functionality. The core problem was identified as a database mismatch (PostgreSQL config in code, but only MongoDB available, then switching to no-DB for Render).

The AI has:
1.  **Migrated the backend from PostgreSQL to an API-only approach** (removing MongoDB dependencies as well) for Render compatibility.
2.  **Created simple, in-memory based AI Chat endpoints** directly within .
    
3.  **Attempted to fix mobile responsiveness** by updating frontend layout components: , , and .
4.  **Performed extensive debugging of router imports and API endpoint registration** in , trying to ensure the AI Chat and other modules were correctly included and accessible.
5.  **Verified that the Dashboard API works and returns 490 houses**, but the frontend display is still problematic.

The last actions involved the AI trying to simplify the AI Chat implementation by embedding it directly in  and debugging its inclusion, ultimately leading to a full rewrite of  to clean up extensive duplications. The user's last feedback explicitly re-stated that AI Chat and Meetings are not working, houses are not loading in the dashboard, self-learning is unverified, and mobile adaptivity is poor.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to fix the AI Chat frontend by connecting it to the  endpoint.
