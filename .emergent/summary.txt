<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully enhanced the VasDom application by implementing several user-requested features and fixes. Key achievements include a comprehensive CSV report of houses (now including elder contacts and handling all 499 houses, with a fast/full report option due to deployment timeouts), a Telegram photo history feature for cleaning events with post links, and critical fixes to the KPI Brigade statistics. The  (Meetings) module was introduced with real-time transcription and AI-powered summary/task extraction, requiring significant dependency resolution and debugging, including fixing OpenAI API key issues and ensuring frontend routing. The process involved iterative debugging, especially with dependency conflicts and deployment challenges, leading to the removal of  to use OpenAI directly. The current focus is on refining the Plannerka module's real-time transcription, specifically by investigating previous working implementations from GitHub branches.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom application, built on a PostgreSQL backend with FastAPI and React, aims to be a Single Brain AI Assistant. It integrates with Bitrix24 and Telegram to manage cleaning operations.
**Core Modules:**
- **Works**: Manages houses and cleanings, including Telegram photo uploads with AI captions, act signed functionality, KPI tracking, and periodicity logic. Required an accurate CSV report of all houses, including elder contacts, and a Telegram photo history feature. KPI calculations for brigades need to be accurate for a selected month.
- **Tasks**: For manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks. The Планерка (Meetings) section, initially removed, was reintroduced with a dictaphone, online transcription, AI-powered summarization, and task extraction, storing data in the DB.
- **Telegram Bot**: Lists houses filtered by brigade/date, allows photo uploads, generates AI captions, forwards photos/captions to multiple Telegram groups, and displays accurate house details.
**Implementation Done So Far:**
- CSV report with all 499 houses, including elder contact details (FIO, phone, email).
- Frontend button for CSV download with Quick Report (no contacts, fast) and Full Report (with contacts, slow).
- Telegram bot saves message IDs and generates post URLs for photo uploads.
- Frontend button Фото в TG on house cards, showing a modal with cleaning photo history.
- KPI Brigade statistics fixed to calculate sums for the entire selected month, not just a day.
- Made with Emergent badge removed from the frontend.
- Plannerka module implemented with UI, backend endpoints for saving meetings, and AI analysis (summary, task extraction).

<pending_tasks>
- **Telegram Bot Photo Resending**: The functionality to resend photos from the frontend Photo in TG modal is still pending. The bot itself needs to be able to send photos to the user from the history.
- **Telegram Bot Chat Not Found**: The bot's ability to send messages to target groups is currently blocked by a chat not found error, requiring the user to add the bot to the group and provide the correct chat ID.
- **Plannerka Real-time Transcription Enhancement**: The current Web Speech API implementation isn't perfectly real-time as expected by the user. An investigation into previous GitHub branches () is underway to find a more robust solution, possibly involving WebSockets or other APIs like OpenAI Whisper.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the real-time transcription issue in the newly implemented Plannerka (Meetings) module. The user reported that text is not showing when I speak on the frontend.

The AI engineer attempted to fix this by modifying . The  (intermediate transcription results from Web Speech API) was not being properly displayed in the textarea. The code was updated to store both  and  states separately and ensure the textarea shows the combined text for real-time feedback.

After these frontend code changes, the user again reported that it does not work and requested to check previous GitHub branches () where a working system was reported to exist.

The AI engineer is currently investigating the user's provided GitHub repository  (and other branches) to understand the previous, successful implementation of real-time speech-to-text, specifically looking for differences in Web Speech API configuration, the use of WebSockets, or alternative APIs like OpenAI Whisper. The usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to analyze the  component or similar speech-to-text implementations within the  GitHub repository to understand its working mechanism for real-time transcription.
