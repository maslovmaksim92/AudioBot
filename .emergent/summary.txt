The AI engineer's work involved an initial misidentification of the codebase, which was quickly corrected by cloning the user's actual GitHub repository. The project then proceeded through four distinct phases, addressing critical fixes, functional enhancements, UI/UX improvements, and analytics. A recurring theme was the need to align frontend expectations with backend data, particularly concerning Bitrix24 integration and environment variable configuration. The AI demonstrated strong debugging skills, pivoting from failed backend API development to client-side analytics when reloader issues persisted. The latest interaction reveals a persistent problem with incorrect data (cleaning types) being returned from the Bitrix24 API, which the AI is currently troubleshooting within the backend service, highlighting the complexity of external integrations and data mapping. The process has been iterative, with the AI consistently seeking user feedback and adapting its plan.

The user's primary goal is to manage cleaning services for residential properties using a VasDom AudioBot application. The core problem at the start was that house cards were not loading, and house information was incomplete or incorrect. This led to a series of requirements:

1.  **Correct House Data Loading**: The application must load 490 houses from Bitrix24 using  (not the old  for 348 houses).
2.  **API Endpoints**: Implement and use , , , , , , , , .
3.  **Environment Configuration**: Correctly set , , , , , ,  in backend, and  in frontend.
4.  **UX Improvements (Phase 1)**: Implement a progress bar and skeleton loading for house data.
5.  **Functional Enhancements (Phase 2)**: Add search, filtering (by brigades, statuses, cleaning dates), and sorting (by address, brigades, apartments, last cleaning date, problem status) for houses. Enhance house cards with detailed information like cleaning schedules, apartment/entrance/floor counts, management company, contact info, and interactive buttons.
6.  **UI/UX Improvements (Phase 3)**: Ensure responsiveness for mobile, virtualization, and pagination for large datasets. Correctly display management company (УК) names and complete cleaning schedules for all relevant months.
7.  **Analytics and Reports (Phase 4)**: Integrate a dashboard with KPIs (houses, apartments, floors, entrances, employees), brigade performance analysis, a cleaning calendar, and management company reports.
8.  **Production Readiness**: Ensure all fixes and features are production-ready, specifically addressing correct УК data and accurate cleaning type descriptions.

The current stage is debugging the backend to correctly retrieve and display cleaning types, which are currently showing as numerical IDs (Тип 2468) instead of descriptive text.

    -   **Importance**: Stores critical backend environment variables like , , , .
    -   **Changes**: Initial fix involved populating it with correct production values and adding  to  for local development.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables, crucially .
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  from a production URL to  for local development.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles all interactions with the Bitrix24 API, including fetching deals (houses), users, and companies. This is critical for data ingestion.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Updated  in  from  to  to fetch 490 houses.
        -   Currently being modified to include  fields for cleaning types in the  parameter of the Bitrix24 API call.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints related to cleaning management, specifically for houses.
    -   **Changes**: Added new endpoints like , , and .

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints for dashboard statistics.
    -   **Changes**: New endpoints for analytics (, ) were initially attempted here but failed to register.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: A new router created to separate analytics endpoints, following the failure to register them in .
    -   **Changes**: Created to contain  and  endpoints, though these endpoints still failed to register on the backend.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file, responsible for including routers and setting up CORS.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Fix for Cleaning Type Descriptions**: The API currently returns numerical IDs (e.g., Тип 2468) for cleaning types instead of their descriptive text. This requires modifying  to retrieve and map these IDs to human-readable descriptions from Bitrix24.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on fixing the issue where the frontend was displaying Тип 2468 instead of the descriptive text for cleaning types. It was determined that the problem lies in the backend, specifically in how the  fetches and processes the cleaning type data from Bitrix24. The AI confirmed that the frontend receives the incorrect ID. The current task involves debugging  to ensure that the correct  fields for cleaning types are included in the Bitrix24 API call and that their descriptive values are returned. The AI has just identified that  fields for cleaning types are not being loaded in the  method within .
