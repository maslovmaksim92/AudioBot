The AI engineer successfully implemented several features and bug fixes for the VasDom application. Initially, the focus was on generating a CSV report of houses with missing data, implementing a Telegram photo history feature, and fixing KPI calculations in the frontend. Key challenges included optimizing the CSV report generation for a large number of houses, which caused timeouts, and correctly fetching elder contact details from Bitrix24. The engineer iteratively refined the report generation, moving from a slow, detailed approach to an optimized, paginated one, and finally to a comprehensive, but potentially long-running, process with a fast, contact-less option. Concurrently, issues with Telegram bot photo forwarding were debugged, leading to the discovery of a chat not found error, indicating configuration problems. The Made with Emergent badge was also removed. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging and adaptation skills, particularly in handling API call limitations and user feedback.

The VasDom application, an evolution of AudioBot, uses a PostgreSQL backend and focuses on a Single Brain AI Assistant for voice commands, data analysis, predictive analytics, and Telegram integration. It prioritizes querying Bitrix24 and PostgreSQL for factual data over LLMs.

Core modules include:
- **Works**: Manages houses and cleaning, integrates Telegram photo uploads with AI captions, allows act signed functionality, tracks KPIs, and implements a complex periodicity logic for cleaning types and frequencies.
- **Tasks**: Handles manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks with a calendar. The Планерка (Meetings/Planner) section was removed from navigation.
- **Employees**: Manages staff, roles, house assignments, and brigade-specific KPIs with a calendar.
- **AI Chat**: Synchronized with Telegram, handles complaints, provides AI responses, and stores dialogue history.
- **Meetings**: Features transcription, summary, and task creation.
- **Training**: Provides educational materials, tracking, quizzes, and AI-powered document summarization.
- **AI-Tasks**: Schedules periodic and one-time tasks.

Specific requests during this trajectory included:
1.  **Missing Data Report**: Generate a comprehensive report (CSV/JSON/dashboard display) of houses lacking address, management company (UK), senior contact, entrances, floors, apartments, and cleaning schedule.
2.  **Telegram Photo History & Resend**: Add a Send photo to TG button on house cards in the Works module. This button should open a modal displaying links to the last 4 (or all) Telegram posts related to cleanings for that house, allowing re-sending photos to Telegram groups. The Telegram bot must save message IDs and post links upon photo upload.
3.  **KPI Brigade Statistics Fixes**: Correctly calculate daily KPI for brigades, ensuring aggregation for the entire month rather than just a single selected day.
4.  **CSV Formatting**: Ensure CSV reports use the correct delimiter for proper opening in Excel.
5.  **Elder Contact in Report**: Include detailed elder contact information (name, phone, email) in the missing data report.
6.  **Deployment Optimization**: Provide a fast report option without detailed elder contacts for quick retrieval, alongside a full report option (which can be slower) to address Render.com's API timeouts.
7.  **Remove Made with Emergent Badge**: Remove the branding badge from the application's production environment.
8.  **Telegram Photo Confirmation**: Ensure photos sent via the Telegram bot are correctly forwarded as confirmation messages back to the user, including the photo and caption.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the webhook for Bitrix24 to send emails to management companies after photo uploads (partially done by configuring target groups, but the Bitrix24 webhook trigger from photo upload completion still needs verification).
- Complete the Send photo to TG button functionality: the modal with the last 4 cleanings and resend capability are in place, but the underlying Telegram bot mechanism for sending photos back to the user is currently failing with a chat not found error.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that Telegram photos were not being correctly re-sent as confirmation messages to the user after a cleaning report. The engineer investigated the  module, specifically the  function and the  and  functions.

It was noted that the bot's sending functions were called, but their return values (indicating success or failure) were not being captured, potentially masking errors. The engineer added explicit result checking and improved logging within  to better diagnose the issue.

After restarting the backend, a diagnostic Python script () was created to simulate photo sending directly via the Telegram Bot API using the configured  and . This test revealed a critical Bad Request: chat not found error, indicating that the bot is either not a member of the specified Telegram group or the  is incorrect. The engineer was in the process of debugging this chat not found error, intending to verify if the bot could send messages to a personal chat as a next step.
