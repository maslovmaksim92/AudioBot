The AI engineer's work primarily focused on developing and refining the Works (Houses) tab of the VasDom AudioBot application. Initially, the AI set up the basic React/FastAPI/MongoDB structure, integrated Emergent LLM, and built the core dashboard components. A major part of the work involved fetching and displaying complex data from Bitrix24 CRM, including filtering houses by a specific funnel (Уборка подъездов ID 34), implementing pagination, and dynamically displaying cleaning schedules, management companies, and brigades. The AI iteratively addressed user feedback, which included formatting data presentation (dates, removing tariffs, specific cleaning types), adding a detailed modal for house, company, and contact information, and fixing recurring frontend loading/rendering issues and backend data fetching discrepancies. The process involved significant refactoring of  and enhancing  for comprehensive CRM data enrichment, particularly for accurate display of company and brigade names. The last task involves correctly mapping  to full brigade names.

The VasDom AudioBot is an intelligent system for managing the VasDom cleaning company. It integrates CRM (Bitrix24), an AI assistant (Emergent LLM), a Telegram bot, and a dashboard for reporting and visualization. The primary problem being solved is centralizing the management of cleaning objects (houses), tasks, employees, and communication.

The current focus is enhancing the Works (Houses) tab:
1.  **Data Source**: Display 490 houses from the Уборка подъездов (cleaning of entrances) funnel (Bitrix24 Deal Stage ID 34).
2.  **House Card Display**:
    *   Show address, number of apartments, entrances, floors.
    *   Display Бригада № with the actual brigade name (e.g., 4 бригада), not just the ID.
    *   Display УК (Управляющая компания) name on the card.
    *   Remove Тариф from cards.
    *   Initially show only September's cleaning schedule on the card, formatted with each date in a distinct square (no timezone).
    *   Display real cleaning types (e.g., Влажная уборка лестничных площадок).
3.  **Pagination**: Implement pagination with options for 10, 50, or 100 houses per page.
4.  **График (Schedule) Button**: A button on the card to open a modal window displaying the full cleaning schedule for all months (September-December 2025).
5.  **Детали (Details) Button**: A button on the card to open a modal window showing comprehensive information:
    *   Full house details.
    *   Complete management company data (name, email, phone, address, website, comments).
    *   Contact person / старший дома (house elder) details (name, phone, email, comments) from CRM.

    *   **Importance**: The core frontend component for the Works tab, handling data fetching, filtering, pagination, and rendering individual house cards.
    *   **Changes**: Underwent multiple iterations. Implemented client-side pagination controls and integrated with the backend's paginated API. Enhanced the display of house cards: removed the Тариф field, replaced raw cleaning schedule with Бригада № (brigade name, currently showing ID), and added the УК (management company) name. Incorporated  for displaying the full multi-month cleaning calendar and  for comprehensive house, company, and contact details.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Correct Brigade Name Display**: The system currently displays the brigade ID (e.g., 1400) instead of the actual brigade name (e.g., 4 бригада) in the house cards. The AI is in the process of fixing this by resolving the  from Bitrix24 to the user's name.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing the user's request to display the correct brigade name (e.g., 4 бригада) instead of just the numerical ID (e.g., 1400) on the house cards and in the detail modal.

The work involves refining the backend's data enrichment logic:
1.  **Bitrix24 User Data Investigation**: The AI has successfully queried Bitrix24 to understand how user IDs (like ) map to user names (brigade names). It found that  can provide the  property for a given  (e.g., ID 1400 maps to 4 бригада). It also explored department data to understand grouping.
2.  **Backend Service Update**: The AI successfully updated . The  function is being modified to fetch the user details using the  from the Bitrix24 deal. This involves making an additional API call to Bitrix24's user service to retrieve the user's name, which represents the brigade name.
3.  **Data Flow**: Once the brigade name is fetched, it needs to be incorporated into the  object that is passed from  to  and then returned by the API.

The last completed action related to this task was an edit to  to enhance  to properly resolve the brigade name. The subsequent step would be to ensure this enriched data is correctly used in the  router and displayed in the frontend.
