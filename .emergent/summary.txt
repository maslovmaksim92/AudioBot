<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the Finances module of the VasDom application. Key phases included the initial development and iterative refinement of a complex financial forecasting feature across multiple company models (УФИЦ модель, ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, ВАШ ДОМ модель). This involved extensive backend () logic adjustments for calculations, dynamic indexing, and category-specific breakdowns, driven by detailed Excel data and user feedback. Significant effort was dedicated to integrating УФИЦ модель cleaner revenue into ВАШ ДОМ модель expenses and adjusting ФОТ. Frontend (, , ) was updated for UI elements, detailed scenario descriptions, unit economics, and crucial mobile responsiveness. The engineer also addressed several bugs, including a  error and an incomplete  function. The last task in the trajectory involved adding export functionality.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom app needed an advanced Financial Analysis module for management reports. This module initially included a **Consolidated Financial View (ВАШ ДОМ модель)**, merging ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ and УФИЦ модель data with specific exclusions and reallocations. A **Forecasting Module (Прогноз 26-30)** was mandated, evolving from simple extrapolation to a dedicated tab with model selection, three scenarios (Pessimistic, Realistic, Optimistic), and Расчеты для инвестора. A critical requirement was integrating **УФИЦ модель forecast data from Excel**, demanding precise per-job-place calculations and annual indexing. Later, **ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ forecast** received detailed scenario descriptions, growth rate adjustments, expense reallocations (e.g., -70% Текущий ремонт to Зарплата), and target margins. Recent tasks involved recalculating ВАШ ДОМ модель to treat Уборщицы revenue from УФИЦ модель as Аутсорсинг персонала expense, with a corresponding ФОТ reduction, and implementing export functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend for API endpoints.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for the frontend UI.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Database for financial data storage.
-   **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilized for efficient API operations.
-   **Environment Variables**: For secure configuration and URL management.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress**: Manages  prefix for backend routing.
-   **Financial Forecasting Logic**: Complex, iterative calculations for revenue, expenses, and profitability.

The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (React).


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central for all financial API logic, especially forecasting.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively modified to implement ВАШ ДОМ модель recalculation (integrating UFIC cleaner revenue as outsourcing expense and reducing FOT), refine ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ and УФИЦ модель scenario descriptions, advantages/disadvantages, and unit economics. Fixed a  error and completed the  function. Implemented dynamic margin adjustments and refined expense categories (НДФЛ removal, grouping Текущий ремонт, обучение).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the financial forecast UI.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to display ВАШ ДОМ+УФИЦ instead of ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ. Integrated UI for detailed scenario descriptions, advantages, disadvantages, and unit economics tables. Adjusted layout for mobile responsiveness, making elements more compact and adapting tables to cards.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main component for the Finances module, handles tab navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to remove ВАШ ДОМ модель from dropdown, adjusted default selection. Added a global export button with initial logic, and re-enabled other tabs like Движение денег and Прибыли и убытки.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays detailed expense breakdown.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for mobile responsiveness, specifically adapting the expense table to prevent overflow on smaller screens.
-   **, , **: Utility scripts, not modified.
-   **, **: Data sources for УФИЦ модель calculations, used in the backend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing export functionality for various financial tabs. The user explicitly requested an экспорт выбранной вкладки: финансы, specifying Выручка расходы анализ и прогноз. The AI engineer had already begun by adding an export button to the main  component and had started to update the export function to handle the actual tab structure. The initial export attempt was confirmed by the testing agent to work for the current tab but found other tabs (Движение денег, Прибыли и убытки) were not accessible. The engineer then added these missing tabs to the UI and was in the process of adding export functionality specifically for the Анализ and Прогноз tabs. The last action in the trajectory was an edit to  to further refine the export button and tab management, followed by a thought about adding a dedicated export button within .

<optional_next_step>
Add a dedicated export button within  to export the forecast data.
