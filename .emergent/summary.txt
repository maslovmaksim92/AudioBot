The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the VasDom application, migrating it to PostgreSQL and implementing core AI assistant and operational features. Significant effort was dedicated to developing and refining the Telegram bot for cleaning brigades, including handling photo uploads, generating AI-powered motivational captions (initially with GPT-4o, then updated to GPT-5 per user request), and ensuring correct routing to multiple Telegram groups.

Key challenges involved debugging Bitrix24 integration for data synchronization, particularly issues with  and  fields, which impacted house listings and periodicity calculations. The engineer iteratively fixed the complex periodicity logic. Frontend issues, such as the white screen bug in KPI Brigade statistics on date changes, incorrect house detail display in the bot, and flawed search functionality, were also addressed. Throughout the process, the engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, adapting to user feedback (e.g., updating Telegram bot token, Bitrix24 webhook URL, AI model), and ensuring critical components like webhook registration were functional.

The VasDom application is an evolution of AudioBot, with a PostgreSQL backend, focused on a Single Brain AI Assistant for voice commands, data analysis, predictive analytics, and Telegram integration. It avoids LLMs for factual data by querying Bitrix24 and PostgreSQL.

Key modules include:
- **Works**: House/cleaning management, Telegram photo upload (with AI captions), act signed button, KPI tracking, and periodicity logic. Periodicity must accurately reflect cleaning types (wet, sweeping, 1st floor only) and frequency.
- **Tasks**: Manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks with a calendar. The Планерка section was previously requested but later removed from navigation.
- **Employees**: Staff management, roles, house assignments, KPIs. Brigade management requires a calendar and detailed KPI per employee.
- **AI Chat**: Synchronized with Telegram, handles complaints, provides AI responses, and stores dialogue history per employee.
- **Meetings**: Transcription, summary, task creation.
- **Training**: Educational materials, tracking, quizzes, and a feature for AI to summarize user-provided documents.
- **AI-Tasks**: Scheduler for periodic and one-time tasks.

The Telegram bot functionality specifically requires listing houses for a given brigade and date, enabling photo uploads, generating AI-powered motivational captions, forwarding photos and captions to public and reporting Telegram groups, and triggering Bitrix24 webhooks for email notifications. It must display accurate house details (entrances, floors, apartments). Frontend dashboard elements, like KPI statistics, need to accurately calculate data for a selected day, and search functionality should work comprehensively across all records.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the webhook for Bitrix24 to send emails to management companies after photo uploads (partially done by configuring target groups, but the Bitrix24 webhook trigger from photo upload completion still needs verification).
- Complete the Send photo to TG button functionality with the modal for the last 4 cleanings in the frontend Works module.
- Provide the full report of houses with missing data (address, management company, senior, entrances, floors, apartments) as requested by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was completing a series of critical fixes and enhancements across the application, heavily focused on the Telegram bot integration and the Works dashboard module.

Specifically, the engineer:
1.  **Telegram Bot Functionality**: Made significant progress on the Telegram bot to allow cleaning brigades to select houses (now correctly filtered by brigade and date), upload photos, and receive AI-generated motivational captions. The bot now sends these photo-caption pairs to both a public Telegram channel and a dedicated reporting channel. The bot's  API calls now use an increased limit to fetch a comprehensive list of houses.
2.  **AI Model Upgrade**: Updated the AI model used for generating photo captions from GPT-4o to GPT-5, ensuring the  is correctly utilized.
3.  **Periodicity Calculation**: Rectified a complex bug in  where cleaning periodicity was incorrectly calculated by summing all dates across all months. The logic was fixed to accurately calculate periodicity per month based on distinct cleaning types, adhering to the user's detailed rules.
4.  **House Data Accuracy**: Addressed issues where the Telegram bot was displaying incorrect details (entrances, floors) for houses by modifying  to correctly fetch these fields from Bitrix24.
5.  **KPI Dashboard Fixes**: Resolved the white screen error in the  component of the frontend's Works module, which occurred when attempting to view KPI statistics for a specific day. This involved refining date handling, ensuring  triggers correctly, and adding robust error handling. The KPI calculation was also updated to report statistics for a *specific day* rather than an entire month.
6.  **Dashboard Enhancements**: Improved the Recommendations feature in  to comprehensively check for missing details in house cards (e.g., address_uk, senior_manager, entrances, floors, apartments, cleaning_schedule).
7.  **Search Functionality**: Enhanced the search capability in the Works module by modifying  to perform a more comprehensive, server-side search across all available houses, ensuring that addresses not on the initially loaded page can still be found.
8.  **Menu Cleanup**: Removed the Планёрка entry from the main navigation menu in  as per user request.
9.  **Environment Variables**: Collaborated with the user to update  and  in the  files and added  for the second Telegram group.

The engineer was in the process of generating a detailed report of houses with missing data based on the API response when the trajectory concluded.
