<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved enhancing the VasDom application. Initially, it successfully integrated a Finances module from a separate branch, facing significant challenges with PostgreSQL's read-only permissions, leading to a temporary shift to  for financial data, before user insistence prompted a renewed attempt at a production-ready database solution (MongoDB was considered but not fully implemented, and the agent fell back to attempting PostgreSQL with existing tables). Concurrently, the engineer addressed issues with call summaries to Telegram and expanded Novofon integration by correctly configuring API keys and updating the . A critical UI issue concerning address search in the Works section was resolved by refining Bitrix24 service logic. Later, the user requested a fully editable financial system, prompting the creation of new CRUD backend routes and frontend management components, including VAT calculation and Adesk.ru-inspired formulas. The Plannerka module was updated to use OpenAI Realtime API. The work ended with the agent addressing a UI error in the Analysis tab and beginning to implement Payment Calendar and Budgets/Plan-Fact Analysis components.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom application is an AI Assistant for cleaning operations, integrating Bitrix24 and Telegram with a PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and React stack.
**Core Features:**
- **Works**: Manages houses and cleanings, including Telegram photo uploads with AI captions, act signed functionality, and KPI tracking. Enhanced with CSV reports, Telegram photo history, and fixed monthly KPI calculations. Address search now works across all houses, not just the first page.
- **Tasks**: Includes manual, Bitrix, and AI-proposed tasks. The Plannerka (Meetings) module features dictaphone recording, real-time transcription (now using OpenAI Whisper Realtime API), AI summarization, and task extraction.
- **Telegram Bot**: Lists houses, handles photo uploads with AI captions, forwards photos/captions, and shows dynamic house listings.
- **Authentication**: Initially Telegram login, replaced by standard login/password with user management and Moscow timezone support. Later, a user requested to bypass login and directly access the dashboard.
- **Call Summaries**: Automatic summarization of Novofon/Bitrix24 calls, sent to Telegram. Enhanced to use Novofon API for all numbers, with a corrected .
- **Financial Analysis**: A newly integrated module designed to be a management report with real data and manual editing/deletion/creation capabilities for all articles and categories (including debts and inventory). It aims to provide comprehensive financial information with daily detail, including VAT (initially 5%), Payment Calendar, and Budgets/Plan-Fact Analysis, inspired by Adesk.ru.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Backend APIs.
- **React**: Frontend UI.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (with persistent read-only issues).
- **OpenAI (Whisper, Realtime API)**: Speech-to-text, AI summaries.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time audio streaming.
- **Bitrix24**: CRM integration (houses, tasks, calls).
- **Telegram Bot API**: Bot interactions, notifications.
- **APScheduler**: Backend task scheduling (call summary agent).
- **Novofon API**: Call data retrieval.
- ****: Client-side data persistence for financial module (temporary).

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement Budgets and Plan-Fact Analysis components and integrate them into the financial system.
- Resolve the underlying PostgreSQL read-only issue for the financial module to move from  to persistent database storage.
- Verify the Novofon API integration and  functionality after  and  were added to  (the last reported check failed to load keys, and a restart was performed but not explicitly re-tested).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the Finances module based on user feedback. The user reported that the Analysis tab was not working and reiterated the need to re-check formulas (referencing Adesk.ru) and add Payment Calendar, Budgets, and Plan-Fact Analysis functionalities.

The AI engineer's most recent actions were:
1.  Diagnosing and fixing an error in  related to  returning an incorrect data structure.
2.  Creating the  component.
3.  Starting the creation of the  component (simplified due to length constraints in the trajectory).

The trajectory ends at the point of starting the  component, indicating that the immediate task is to continue building out these new financial analysis features and ensuring their correct integration and functionality. The Analysis tab bug was being addressed concurrently with the addition of these new components.

<optional_next_step>
Create and integrate the Budgets and Plan-Fact Analysis component into the frontend.
