The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the Finances module of the VasDom application, transitioning it into a comprehensive management report. The initial phase involved resolving critical backend and frontend issues, then iteratively building out complex financial reporting features. A significant portion of the work revolved around developing a consolidated financial view, which underwent multiple iterations of refinement based on precise user feedback regarding calculation logic and category exclusions. This included dynamic company renaming and the introduction of a new forecasting module with multiple scenarios. The process demonstrated an iterative development cycle, with the AI engineer meticulously debugging syntax errors, adjusting complex financial calculations, and updating both backend API endpoints and frontend UI components in response to user clarifications and data inconsistencies.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom application required an advanced Financial Analysis module for management reporting. Key requirements and their evolution included:
1.  **Consolidated Financial View (ВАШ ДОМ модель)**: Combine data from ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ and УФИЦ модель with complex, category-specific adjustments. This involved renaming ООО ВАШ ДОМ to ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, УФИЦ to УФИЦ модель, and ООО ВАШ ДОМ + УФИЦ to ВАШ ДОМ модель. Initial logic was simple addition/subtraction, evolving to ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ only for most categories, ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ minus УФИЦ модель Зарплата for Зарплата, 5% of monthly revenue for Налоги, and excluding Кредиты, Швеи, Аутсорсинг персонала с Ю/ЦЛ, Юридические услуги, and Продукты питания. Аутсорсинг персонала was later added, derived from specific monthly payments for cleaners.
2.  **Monthly Expense & Revenue Details**: Provide detailed breakdowns for company-specific and consolidated views.
3.  **Debt Management**: Populate with real debt data, removing  reliance.
4.  **UI Refinements**: Remove redundant tabs and integrate company/model selectors.
5.  **Forecasting Module**: Implement a Прогноз 26-30 section with annual projections (2026-2030) using simple extrapolation. This evolved into a dedicated tab with model selection (ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, УФИЦ модель, ВАШ ДОМ модель) and three scenarios (Pessimistic, Realistic, Optimistic), including Расчеты для инвестора.
6.  **UFIC Model from Excel**: Integrate УФИЦ модель forecast data (including cleaner counts) directly from a provided Excel file, with specific calculation logic based on current per-job-place metrics and forecasted job places.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (React).


-   ****: Central financial API.
    -   **Importance**: Contains all financial logic, API endpoints for expenses, revenue, profit/loss, debts, and the newly added  endpoint.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for consolidated logic (, , ), company renaming (from Консолидированный to ВАШ ДОМ модель), and the new forecast calculation with scenario support for ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, УФИЦ модель, and ВАШ ДОМ модель. Resolved several syntax and indentation errors.
-   ****: Main financial dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the financial tabs and overall layout.
    -   **Changes**: Updated company options from ООО ВАШ ДОМ, УФИЦ to ВАШ ДОМ ФАКТ, УФИЦ модель, and ВАШ ДОМ модель. Added a new tab for Прогноз 26-30.
-   ****, ****, ****: Financial reporting components.
    -   **Importance**: Display specific financial reports.
    -   **Changes**: Updated company selectors to reflect new names.  initially housed the forecast, which was later removed.
-   ** (NEW)**: Component for displaying financial forecasts.
    -   **Importance**: Dedicated UI for the Прогноз 26-30 tab, including model and scenario selectors, and investor calculations.
-   ** (NEW)**: Script to update company names in the database.
    -   **Importance**: Facilitated the renaming of company identifiers across existing data.
-   ** (NEW)**: Script to add specific revenue entries for the ВАШ ДОМ модель.
    -   **Importance**: Populated necessary baseline data for the new consolidated model's revenue calculations.
-   ** (NEW)**: Script to add specific Аутсорсинг персонала transactions for ВАШ ДОМ модель.
    -   **Importance**: Provided precise monthly data for a key expense category in the consolidated view.

<pending_tasks>
-   Refine the УФИЦ модель forecast calculation to accurately reflect the user's latest specific logic: dividing current УФИЦ факт 2025 metrics by current job places, then multiplying by forecasted job places (60 pessimistic, 65 realistic, 70 optimistic), fixing these numbers for Feb 2026, and applying annual indexing to revenue and expenses.
-   Verify the Novofon API integration and  functionality (from initial , deprioritized).
-   Further development/integration for Budgets and Plan-Fact Analysis components (from initial , potentially deprioritized or removed).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in accurately implementing the УФИЦ модель forecast based on user-provided Excel data and specific calculation rules. The user had highlighted that the previously implemented УФИЦ модель forecast numbers were not matching the provided Excel file. The user clarified the precise logic: take УФИЦ факт 2025 data, divide by the current number of job places to get a per-job-place metric, and then multiply by the *forecasted* number of job places (60 for pessimistic, 65 for realistic, 70 for optimistic) for Feb 2026 onwards, applying an annual indexing rate (e.g., 6%) to revenue and expenses thereafter. The AI engineer had just finished reading the latest screenshot containing the clarified job count figures and was in the process of creating a script or modifying existing code ( was created as a planning artifact) to implement this new, precise forecasting logic.
