The AI engineer successfully guided the VasDom AudioBot project through critical debugging, performance optimization, and significant feature additions. Initially, the focus was on resolving incorrect Bitrix24 management company and personnel data, which required detailed API response analysis and implementing separate API calls for user and company details. This led to a performance bottleneck, prompting the introduction of caching, batch processing, and fallback logic, improving API response times from minutes to seconds. Subsequently, a major new feature‚Äîa Tasks tab integrated with Bitrix24‚Äîwas designed, implemented (both backend and frontend), and thoroughly tested. The work concluded with updating the project documentation (README.md) and enhancing the UI with dynamic glow effects across multiple components. The trajectory demonstrates a methodical problem-solving approach, iterative development, and comprehensive testing, culminating in a robust and visually enhanced application.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom AudioBot is an AI-powered business management application for a cleaning and construction company, integrated with Bitrix24 CRM to manage multi-apartment buildings and cleaning brigades. The user's primary goal was to enhance Houses Management by correctly loading 490 houses, 29 management companies, and detailed house information from Bitrix24, including multi-month cleaning schedules. Recent explicit requests included:
1. Making Houses Management visually engaging (–í–ê–£ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª), integrating a user-provided logo, and making addresses clickable to Google Maps.
2. Adding a Create House button that creates an entry in Bitrix24 with address as the mandatory field.
3. Correcting management company (–£–ö) and assigned personnel data from Bitrix24, specifically mapping , , , , and deriving brigade names.
4. Adding a new Tasks tab to synchronize with Bitrix24, allowing task creation and viewing with statistics and filtering.
5. Updating  to reflect the current application state (structure, functions, links, keys).
6. Implementing glowing/gradient visual effects (–ø–µ—Ä–µ–ª–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ) on UI elements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the Tasks tab, integrating it fully with Bitrix24 for viewing and creating tasks. This involved significant backend development in  and , and corresponding frontend development in , , and . All task-related API endpoints were thoroughly tested using the backend testing agent, confirming 100% success. The frontend UI and functionality were verified via automated Playwright testing, also achieving 100% success, confirming navigation, UI elements, statistics, filters, task list, create modal, API integration, and mobile responsiveness.

Following the successful implementation and testing of the Tasks feature, the user requested an update to the  file, which was fully executed to include all new features, architectural details, links, API keys, and performance metrics. Finally, the user requested adding glowing visual effects to various UI blocks and to re-check the brigade data. The AI confirmed brigades were working locally and added extensive gradient glow effects to components in both  and , making the UI more visually engaging. The engineer confirmed the  issue on production was due to deployment lag, not a functional bug, as local tests were successful. The last action was a comprehensive report detailing all accomplished work, links, keys, code structure, and performance metrics.
