The AI engineer's work on the VasDom AudioBot commenced by addressing user-reported code quality and stability issues. This included fixing an  validation flaw in , refining exception handling in  to return HTTP 500s, adding missing newlines, and resolving a frontend navigation bug. After these foundational fixes, the engineer focused on implementing new WOW features: integrating a user-provided logo, making addresses clickable to Google Maps, and adding a backend endpoint and frontend button for Create House in Bitrix24. Lastly, the engineer tackled a critical issue regarding incorrect management company (УК) and assigned personnel data from Bitrix24, updating the backend to use specific Bitrix24 fields and replace old derivation logic. However, the latest test indicates that the real Bitrix24 fields for UK and assigned personnel are still not being correctly retrieved, necessitating further debugging.

<product_requirements>
The VasDom AudioBot is an AI-powered business management application for a cleaning and construction company, designed to integrate with Bitrix24 CRM for managing multi-apartment buildings and cleaning brigades. Key existing features include a FastAPI backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL with Alembic, voice features, AI (Emergent LLM), a dashboard, and a Telegram bot.

The immediate past work focused on enhancing Houses Management by correctly loading 490 houses from Bitrix24 (Category ID 34), integrating detailed house information (apartments, floors, addresses, tariffs, multi-month cleaning schedules with specific Bitrix24 field IDs), loading 29 real management companies, and implementing advanced filters. A visually appealing Houses Management (Works) page was developed with a РЯДОМ logo, gradient designs, a calendar, CSV export, sorting, and view toggling, with an emphasis on dashboard accuracy.

Recent user requests included making the Houses Management section more visually engaging (ВАУ функционал), integrating a provided logo, making addresses clickable to open Google Maps, and adding a Create House button that creates an entry in Bitrix24, with address as the sole mandatory field. Subsequent feedback highlighted issues with incorrect management company data and the use of  URLs, requiring the system to correctly map Bitrix24's , , , and  fields, and to derive brigade names from responsible personnel.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a modular full-stack architecture.

   - :
      - Summary: Defines Pydantic data models for API requests and responses.
      - Changes: Expanded  model with detailed fields (e.g., apartments, floors, schedules). A new  was introduced for Bitrix24 house creation, requiring an .
   - :
      - Summary: Centralized service for Bitrix24 CRM API interactions.
      - Changes: Modified to fetch 490 houses from . Updated deal retrieval to map specific Bitrix24 custom field IDs for house details and cleaning schedules. Added a  method. Recently,  fields were updated to include , , , ,  for accurate management company and responsible person data.
   - :
      - Summary: FastAPI router handling API endpoints for house management and cleaning.
      - Changes: Integrated the new  model and enhanced filtering. Added a new POST endpoint  for creating houses in Bitrix24. The logic for deriving  and  was updated to use the newly fetched Bitrix24  and  fields, replacing previous heuristic-based extraction.
   - :
      - Summary: Provides security utilities, specifically API key validation.
      - Changes: Corrected the  function to properly extract and validate the  header, fixing a security bypass.
   - :
      - Summary: Defines endpoints for voice message processing.
      - Changes: Replaced a general  with  to prevent masking errors and provide clearer API responses for internal server errors.
   - :
      - Summary: Manages PostgreSQL database connection settings.
      - Changes: Minor stylistic improvements, breaking long lines for better code readability.
   - :
      - Summary: Manages global state for the React application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing user-reported issues regarding incorrect management company (УК) data and the presence of  URLs.

The  URL issue was resolved by ensuring the  in  points to the correct Render deployment URL (). Additionally, hardcoded  references within  and  were updated to use the Render URL. This ensures the frontend correctly communicates with the deployed backend.

For the management company data issue, the backend was updated. In , new fields (, , , , ) were added to the  array for fetching deals from Bitrix24. Subsequently, the logic in  was modified to extract the  directly from  and to determine the  from the  fields, replacing previous logic that heuristically derived these values (e.g., from house address).

However, a recent test using  to the  endpoint revealed that despite these changes, the  and  fields in the returned  objects were still empty or incorrect. This indicates that the Bitrix24 API might not be returning the expected data for these specific fields, or their field IDs might be different, or they might require separate API calls. The engineer's last action was to investigate the raw Bitrix24 response to understand why these fields are not being correctly populated.

<optional_next_step>
Inspect the raw Bitrix24 API response to debug why the  and  fields are not being correctly retrieved for management companies and assigned personnel.
